This app allows you to store your different expenses in an organized way. It also contains local storage so your data won't get lost and full responsiveness so you can view it on any device that is convenient to you.

This was the second app I built using React now I am starting to realize why React has become an industry standard for front end developent. I also learned the power of Bootstrap and deplying an app to Heroku.
